##Technology Stack
Schedufy mobile app is built using Flutter, a mobile development framework developed by Google. Flutter allows us to build high-performance, cross-platform apps for iOS and Android with a single codebase.

We use Firebase as the backend for the app, which provides us with features such as authentication, real-time database, cloud storage, and cloud functions.

We also use third-party APIs and services, such as Stripe and Google Maps, to provide additional functionality to the app.
